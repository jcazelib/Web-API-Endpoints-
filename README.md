Purpose -
The content included here demonstrates Python implementations for either Client Portal Gateway authentication or through OAuth 1.0a. This should not be used as an example of a perfect trading system, but a means of implementing our RESTful API with standard Python libraries.

Note about OAuth 1.0a Implementation -
For users looking to use utilize the OAuth 1.0a implementation, please be aware that you must have a funded ORG or Institutional account through Interactive Brokers, with approved access for the OAuth self-service portal, provided by the IBKR API Support team for qualified accounts.
